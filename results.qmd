You have a lot of freedom to choose what to do, as long as you restrict yourselves to exploratory techniques (rather than modeling / prediction approaches). In addition, your analysis must be clearly documented and reproducible.

Provide a short nontechnical summary of the most revealing findings of your analysis written for a nontechnical audience. Take extra care to clean up your graphs, ensuring that best practices for presentation are followed, as described in the  audience ready style section  below.

Use subheadings (##) as appropriate. See  Todd Schneiderâ€™s blog posts  for examples of thoughtful, informative subheadings. An approach that works well is to create a subheading for each of your research questions.

The number of graphs will vary by project; we suggest a target of 10. (A plot with multiple facets counts as 1 graph).  If you go over, make sure they are high quality and include commentary.  A project with 10 good graphs plus commentary will receive a better grade than a project with 10 good graphs and 10 mediocre ones.

# Results

## Data pre-processing
To conduct deeper analysis on our data, we added the following columns to our dataset:
1. `BMI`: the Body Mass Index of each person, a continuous variable calculated using the [World Health Organization guideline](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/topic-details/GHO/body-mass-index): `$BMI = \frac{Weight}{Height^2}$`
2. `IsOverweight`: a binary categorical value whose value is 1 if the `BMI` of the person is more than 25, 0 otherwise.

These columns serve as alternate metrics of the obesity of an individual, a **continuous variable** and a **binary categorical variable**, to complement `NObeyesdad`, the obesity category level which is a **ordinal categorical variable**.

We also made modifications to the data types of certain columns, as follows:
